A. Not at the moment, but we're working on it. You can satisfy your map cravings for the time being by ordering a napkin or blanket from <a href="http://softcities.net">http://softcities.net</a> or printing your own at <a href="http://maps.stamen.com/m2i">http://maps.stamen.com/m2i</a></p>

<p><b>Q. Can you answer student questions or entertain student visits?</b></br>
A. Sorry, but reluctantly no, we're too busy working. We're interested in relationships with schools and universities that can be mutually beneficial, but individual or group student visits are more than we can currently handle. If you are interested in hiring us to teach at your university or school, please reach out to our Education and Outreach Manager: beth [at] stamen [dot] com.</p>
