<p>Stamen's <a href="/clients/">client work</a> and the <a href="/projects">research projects</a> we pursue present us with as broad a variety of design challenges as we could hope for: from providing live views of <a href="/clients/digg">social networks as they happen</a> to covering <a href="/clients/adobe">live bicycle races</a> over the internet, from building <a href="/clients/bmw"> collaborative applications for car designers</a> to describing the lifetime output of an <a href="/clients/acconci">all-but-uncategorizable artist/architect</a>. </p>
