A faster Stamen site

How to zinnia
-------------
Zinnia is written for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). To run this locally, you should just need to:
   * Check this repo out
   * [Install Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/quickstart/)
   * Run `jekyll serve -w` in the root directory of the checkout
   * Go to [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) in your browser
   
Thats it for now. As of writing this we are in the early stages of this effort.

Here is [where it lives on the internets](http://stamen.github.io/zinnia/)
